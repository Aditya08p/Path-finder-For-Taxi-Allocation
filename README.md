# Path Finder for Taxi Allocation

## Introduction
This project aims to design a robust taxi allocation system using efficient data structures and algorithms to optimize urban transportation. It solves real-world problems such as reducing passenger wait times and optimizing resource utilization.

## Features
- **Efficient Taxi Allocation:** Uses priority queues and graphs to allocate taxis dynamically.
- **Shortest Route Calculation:** Implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find optimal paths.
- **User-Friendly Booking System:** Employs Trie data structures for quick location searches.

## Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler:** GCC or Clang
- **Development Tools:** Make or CMake (optional)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Path-Finder-Taxi-Allocation.git
   cd Path-Finder-Taxi-Allocation
2. Build and Run:
   ```bash
